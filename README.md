## Forecasting

<i>For this case study, I looked at different pieces of historical records pertaining to tourism in India. My task is to provide business context to forecast future tourist trends. In order to do this, I examine trends and seasonality within the data, find correlations between different datasets, and develop an ARIMA model to forecast the tourist levels for the next 6 months.</i>
